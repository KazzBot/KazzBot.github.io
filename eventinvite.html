<img id="yy" src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/seasonal/fireworks-over-harbor.png" alt="Splatfest Picture">
<p>The details:</p>
<ul>
    <li>This invite goes out to every single person listed in Inkopolis's system as a ranked player. <br> In other words, this is just to let you know. You aren't special or anything.</li>
    <li>In case you didn't know, Yin and Yang is a symbol in Taoism, with a dark and bright side <br> creating a circle. Yin is a negative and passive principle in nature, while Yang is a positive and <br> active principle in nature.</li>
    <li>Choose whichever side you want to be for the festival. You will battle for that side, and when the <br> festival is over you will win rewards. If your side wins, you win more rewards + bragging rights!</li>
</ul>
<h3> So get out there, and go splat for your team!</h3>
