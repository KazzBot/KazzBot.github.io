<h6>January 1, 2008</h6>

<p>Hey guys, I finally made it to where I was going. The reason I couldn't <br> blog until now is because the place that shall not be named took my <br> information down, so I had to start a new blog, <br> and I couldn't tell you guys <strong>THE TRUTH.</strong><br> <em>The truth is that the Mushroom Kingdom is jealous of the USA's quality hot dogs, and <br> are going to inflitrate the US and TAKE OUR RECIPE!!!!!</em> Rip us if <br> they succeed. And btw, I'm in Sweden right now. Cool place. Stay woke.
